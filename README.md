# QCRAFT-Scheduler
QCRAFT Scheduler: A tool to optimize the scheduling of quantum tasks in quantum computing environments by combining quantum circuits. 

The scheduler has the following main functions:

1. **Circuit Reception:** Users submit their quantum circuits to the scheduler for execution. Each user specifies the number of shots required and sends the circuit via the URL generated by a quantum circuit simulator such as Quirk or via Python code, such as IBM's Qiskit language.

2. **Queuing:** Submitted circuits are added to a queue, and each user receives a unique identifier for execution. Circuits are scheduled for execution in cycles, where the scheduler waits for the available qubits to fill before scheduling the circuits.

3. **Quantum Policies:** During scheduling, the scheduler combines circuits based on the availability of qubits in the quantum machine. It uses three different scheduling policies, which can be selected by the user.

4. **Combined Circuit Execution:** Once the circuits have been combined, the scheduler schedules the execution of the combined circuit in the quantum machine. The results of this execution are a combination of the results of each individual circuit.

5. **Unshceduling of the results:** These results go through a unscheduling process to divide the results by user, and are stored in a database.
